\section*{Abstract}
This project aims to automate the conversion of Data Transferable Objects (DTOs) between different programming languages, eliminating a time-consuming task for developers and reducing errors that may occur in manual conversion. 
The approach involves creating a schema that details the structure of all DTOs, which can be converted into Software Development Kits (SDKs). This schema can be auto-generated by a Schema Provider, compared to previous versions by a Diff Checker, and converted into an SDK by a Schema Consumer.

The report presents a prototype demonstrating this approach's feasibility. While the prototype shows promising results, further work is required to adapt this solution to real-world scenarios. Overall, this project has the potential to significantly reduce development time and effort, and minimize bugs associated with manual DTO conversion.
