\section{Conclusion}
This paper set out to validate the hypothesis, that an automated SDK generation could save both time and reduce errors. 
To validate the hypothesis, the time it takes a developer, and the amount of bugs is created in the process are compared with the automated prototype.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Savings}: The prototype shows a clear indication that the potential time saving is quite significant. It goes from approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes to shy of 200 microseconds to create the same SDK.
    \item \textbf{Error Reduction}: The reduction of errors is not as proven, as the time savings, This is mainly due to the limitations of the SDK. As described in Section \ref{sec:evaluation:performence_evaluation}, the prototype is shipped with known casing bugs. However, with further development, the rate of bugs can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, once a bug is addressed in the prototype, it will be permanently fixed, and not occur again.
\end{itemize}

As the sub-hypothesis has been validated, the main hypothesis is also validated.
